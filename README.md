# LS_webDev
Uploading the submission for web development course of learnerspace

** please note that I have uploaded all the files relevant to week1 on the main branch and all the files of week2 (including video) on the master branch respectively. There had been some problem at my end and hence I couldn't push the folders on github or github pages (it kept showing some error).
